## The Prosecutor's Advantage

For over 12 years, I served as an **Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney** in Jefferson County, prosecuting everything from narcotics trafficking to violent crimes. 

I also served as a **Special Assistant United States Attorney** (Western District of Kentucky), prosecuting federal gun and drug cases.

I know how the state builds a case—because for over a decade, I was the one building them.

*   I worked with the **Heroin Investigation Team** on fatal overdose cases.
*   I worked with the **Project Safe Neighborhood Team** to reduce violent crime.

### Why This Matters for Your Defense

When you hire me, you aren't just hiring a defense lawyer. You are hiring someone who understands the internal playbook of the prosecutor's office.

*   **I know where the leverage is.**
*   **I know where mistakes are made.**
*   **I know how to negotiate from strength.**
