Expungement is a legal process that results in the removal of a conviction or arrest from a person's criminal record. In Kentucky, once a charge is expunged, it is deemed to have never occurred, and the person may legally deny the existence of the record (with some exceptions).

Not all crimes are eligible for expungement. While most misdemeanors and many Class D felonies can be expunged after a waiting period (usually 5 years after completion of sentence), serious violent offenses and sex crimes typically cannot.
