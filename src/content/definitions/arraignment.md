## What is an Arraignment?

An **arraignment** is the initial step in the criminal court process in Kentucky. It typically occurs within 24 to 48 hours of an arrest if the defendant is in custody.

At the arraignment, the judge will:
1.  Formally read the charges against the defendant.
2.  Ask the defendant to enter a plea (Guilty, Not Guilty, or No Contest).
3.  Address the issue of **bail** or bond (setting conditions for release).

### Strategic Importance

It is almost always advisable to plead **Not Guilty** at arraignment to allow your defense attorney time to review the evidence (discovery).
