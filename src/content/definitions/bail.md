Bail is a set amount of money that acts as insurance between the court and the person in jail (the defendant). Defendants have the option to pay their bail in cash or assets to be released from jail while awaiting trial. If the defendant shows up for all court dates, the bail is returned. If they fail to appear, the bail is forfeited and a warrant is issued for their arrest.

In Kentucky, judges consider several factors when setting bail, including the severity of the alleged crime, the defendant's criminal history, and their ties to the community (flight risk).
