An indictment is a formal accusation that a person has committed a crime. In serious cases (felonies), a prosecutor presents evidence to a grand jury—a group of citizens who decide whether there is enough evidence to charge the suspect.

If the grand jury issues an indictment ("True Bill"), the case proceeds to the Circuit Court for trial. An indictment is not a conviction; it is merely the formal start of the prosecution process for felonies.
