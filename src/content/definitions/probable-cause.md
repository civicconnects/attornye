Probable cause is the legal standard by which police authorities have reason to obtain a warrant for the arrest of a suspected criminal or the issuing of a search warrant. It requires more than a mere suspicion that a crime has been committed, but does not require absolute certainty.

In a DUI stop, for example, observing erratic driving, the smell of alcohol, or failed field sobriety tests establishes probable cause to arrest the driver.
