A plea bargain is a negotiated agreement between a criminal defendant and a prosecutor. In exchange for the defendant agreeing to plead guilty or "no contest" to certain crimes, the prosecutor may drop one or more charges, reduce a charge to a less serious offense, or recommend a specific sentence to the judge.

Plea bargains are extremely common in the criminal justice system as they resolve cases without the need for a lengthy and expensive trial. However, accepting a plea deal means waiving the right to a trial by jury.
