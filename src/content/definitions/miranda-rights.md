"You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law..."

These are the Miranda Rights (or Miranda Warning), which come from the U.S. Supreme Court case *Miranda v. Arizona*. Police must read these rights to a suspect only when two conditions are met:
1.  The suspect is in **custody** (arrested).
2.  The suspect is being **interrogated**.

If police fail to read these rights before a custodial interrogation, any statements made by the suspect may be inadmissible in court.
