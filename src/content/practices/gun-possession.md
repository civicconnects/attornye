Gun charges in Kentucky can be extremely serious, especially when federal authorities are involved. Whether it's possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, carrying a concealed deadly weapon without a permit, or using a firearm during the commission of a crime, the penalties can be severe.

As a former prosecutor who handled federal gun cases as a Special Assistant U.S. Attorney, I know the specific triggers that turn a state case into a federal indictment. I use this knowledge to fight for your freedom.
