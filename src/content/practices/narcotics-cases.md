Drug trafficking charges in Kentucky carry severe mandatory minimum/maximum penalties. Prosecutors often "stack" charges to increase leverage.

As a former prosecutor who worked with the Heroin Investigation Team, I know how these investigations are conducted. I know how to challenge the search warrants, the wiretaps, and the confidential informants used to build the case against you.
