Federal court is a different world. The prosecutors (AUSAs) have smaller caseloads and more resources. The sentencing guidelines are rigid and harsh.

If you have received a target letter or have been indicted federally, you need an attorney who has actually stood in a federal courtroom. I served as a Special Assistant U.S. Attorney. I know the federal playbook because I used to use it.
