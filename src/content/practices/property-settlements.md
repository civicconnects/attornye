Property disputes, whether arising from divorce, probate, or business dissolution, often require aggressive negotiation and litigation. We bring the same "trial-ready" mindset from criminal defense to protecting your assets.

We ensure that:
*   Assets are properly valued.
*   Hidden assets are uncovered.
*   Your financial future is protected during settlement negotiations.
