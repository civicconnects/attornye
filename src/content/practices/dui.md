## The Charge: DUI in Kentucky

In Kentucky, a DUI charge (Operating a Motor Vehicle under the Influence) is not just a traffic ticket—it is a criminal offense with immediate consequences for your license, your freedom, and your record.

### Why You Need a Former Prosecutor

I have prosecuted hundreds of DUI cases. I know exactly what the police are trained to look for, and more importantly, **where they make mistakes**. 

We investigate:
1.  **Reasonable Suspicion**: Did the officer have a valid legal reason to pull you over?
2.  **Field Sobriety Tests**: Were the instructions given correctly? (They rarely are).
3.  **Breathalyzer Calibration**: Was the machine properly maintained?

Don't plead guilty without a fight.
